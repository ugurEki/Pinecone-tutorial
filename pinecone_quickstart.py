# project = warehouse, index = storage type, namespace = storage section, record = storage bin.

# We need an API key to make calls to Pinecone project.

## Create an index
# In Pinecone, there are two types of indexes for storing vector data :
# Dense indexes : store dense vectors for semantic search. 
# (numerical representations of the meaning and relationships of text, image and others)
# Sparse indexes : store sparse vectors for lexical/keyword search. 
# (numerical representations of the words or phrases in a document. It is used for lexical search)

# Target the index :
# Because your index is integrated with an embedding model, you provide the textual -
# statements and pinecone converts them to dense vectors automatically.

## Upsert text (Upsert = Update + Insert)
# Prepare a sample dataset of factual statements from different domains like -
